* Developed and maintained multiple data systems, including hotel ranking, dynamic pricing, and customer analytics platforms, resulting in [quantifiable achievement, e.g., a 15% increase in conversion rates].
* Designed and implemented ETL pipelines using Python (Pandas, Requests), Apache Airflow, and SQL to process large-scale travel data (volumes, if possible).
* Collaborated with cross-functional teams (specify teams) to implement data-driven solutions, leading to [quantifiable achievement, e.g., a 10% reduction in operational costs].
* Implemented CI/CD pipelines and containerized services using Docker; established comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems for data jobs.
* Developed key projects including:

    * **CRR Dashboard:**  Developed a secure Streamlit dashboard with LDAP-based authentication for role-based access, featuring automated report generation, CSV exports, and caching for optimized performance.  Utilized Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Requests, APIs, and CSV.  Integrated data from EYC, PWC, and CIPLA APIs.
    * **Hotel Ranking System:** Architected a hotel scoring system integrating geospatial databases (PostgreSQL, PostGIS) for precise location-based metrics.  Built an ETL pipeline and Streamlit dashboard for visualization. Optimized queries using spatial indexes and materialized views for faster map rendering.  Utilized Flask, PostgreSQL, Streamlit, and PostGIS.
    * **Yatra Travel Chatbot:** Engineered an intelligent chatbot using FastAPI, Redis, Dialogflow, and Streamlit to handle complex flight and hotel queries.  Implemented backend webhook services with robust error handling, rate limiting, and logging.
